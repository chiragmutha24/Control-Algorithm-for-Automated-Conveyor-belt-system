# Control-Algorithm-for-Automated-Conveyor-belt-system

AuE6860 - Digital Manufacturing - Team Automates
This repository consists of all the scripts during the duration of this course.

Team Automates consists of the following members:

1) Mihir Bangale
2) Shubham Garde
3) Chirag Mutha

A workspace has been created that holds all the python code developed during this course. Following is a list of all the pyhton code:
1) hx711.py - Load cell amplifier logic to measure the weight.
2) Final_Integration.py - Contains the full code to measure weight and providing conveyor belt speed control based on the weight of the component.

For in depth information on part selection, electronic components, electrical connections and pseudo code please refer Project Report in the "Report" folder
